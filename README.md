# Bank Loan Performance Dashboard – Power BI

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard developed to analyze a bank loan dataset. The goal is to understand overall loan performance, repayment behavior, and identify key trends based on borrower demographics and financial metrics.

## 📌 Description

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of loan application and repayment data. It uses interactive visuals, DAX measures, and slicers to uncover insights across three main pages: **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Details**.

- **Summary Page**: High-level KPIs such as total loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, and loan status distribution (good vs. bad loans).
- **Overview Page**: Visual trends in loan amounts by state, purpose, employment length, home ownership, and monthly loan issuance.
- **Details Page**: Row-level data for deep dives and further exploration.
